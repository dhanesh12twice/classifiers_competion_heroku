# Classifiers Competition

Deployed on heroku : [Classifiers in a Competition](https://classifier-competition.herokuapp.com/)

A Competition on various Machine learning classification algorithms to find who gives the best accuracy score on popular datasets. 

This streamlit app is for performing Classification on Popular datasets by using Popular Machine Learning Classifiers. It allows us to vary different hyperparameter values for the models for efficient model. It has **Principal Component Analysis(PCA)** component to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.

Classifiers used:
* KNeighbors Classifier
* Support Vector Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

Datasets used:
* Scikit-learn Iris dataset
* Scikit-learn Wine dataset
* Scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset
